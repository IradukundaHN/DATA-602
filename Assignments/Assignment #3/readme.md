## DATA 602 Assignment #3

### Objective
The main objective is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the white wine quality dataset by:
1. Identifying the inputs or independent variables and the target or dependent variable in our dataset
2. Checking data types of those variables
3. Checking and cleaning the missing values
4. Summarizing the descriptive statistics
5. Visualizing the correlation and relationships between variables as well as density distribution for each variable


### Dataset Description
The Wine Quality Dataset is described from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality). 
The csv file was read directly from the data source: [UMBC's Small Dataset Repo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UMBC-Data-Science/DATA602Datasets/main/winequality-white.csv).
